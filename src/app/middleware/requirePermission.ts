/**
 * Narrows what a team member may do WITHIN the role checkAuth already allowed.
 *
 * Always sits after checkAuth on a route, never instead of it: the role gate is
 * the outer boundary and this cannot widen it. A route that is owner-and-manager
 * only stays owner-and-manager only however the checkboxes are set.
 *
 * Two deliberate escape hatches, both of which make this safe to put on a live
 * system:
 *
 *   - An owner always passes. Locking an owner out of their own workspace with a
 *     checkbox is never the intent and there would be no way back.
 *   - A user with NO permissions stored passes. Every existing team member has
 *     an empty column on the morning of the upgrade, so nobody loses access to
 *     anything they had yesterday. Restrictions begin only once somebody has
 *     actually ticked boxes for that user.
 *
 * Several names may be given, and holding ANY of them is enough - "Edit Sale"
 * covers a route that both editing and re-pricing reach.
